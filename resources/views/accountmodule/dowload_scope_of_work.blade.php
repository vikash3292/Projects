                    Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is an important and

                    fully understood and taken into account before the development is allowed to go ahead.

                    considers it essential that such development does not result in indiscriminate and destructive uses
                    of natural and other resources, nor should it lead to adverse environmental consequences at present

                    The term EIA describes a technique and a process by which information about the environmental

                    account by the Concerned Authority (CA) in forming their judgment on whether the proposed
                    development should go ahead. The CA also obtains from PP such additional information as may be
                    considered necessary to decide on the proposed development, especially those affecting the
                    environment, which should form the material considerations for a proper decision. </td>
